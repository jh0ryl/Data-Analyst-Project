- Visualization and communication tools (Tableau, Power BI, PowerPoint) are strongly demanded for analyst roles, highlighting the importance of turning data into clear insights for decision-making, whereas Data Engineering shifts focus toward technical implementation rather than presentation.

- Python, cloud platforms (Azure, AWS), and big data technologies like Spark are concentrated in Data Engineer roles, indicating a growing shift toward modern data infrastructure, automation, and scalable data pipelines as organizations evolve their data maturity.
