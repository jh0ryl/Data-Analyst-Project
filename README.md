## Insights 

## The Data Industry in the Philippines Is Still Analyst-Heavy

The dominance of Excel and SQL suggests that many companies still operate at a traditional or intermediate analytics maturity level, where dashboards and reporting are the core responsibilities.

## 1. Universal Skills: Excel & SQL
